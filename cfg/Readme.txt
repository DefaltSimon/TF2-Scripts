My TF2 scripts.
They are just a bunch of useful scripts I put together from various sources and kept only really useful ones.

You're welcome.

KEYBINDS:

0			- says ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) in chat
"walkway"		- loads tr_walkway_rc2
p			- switch weapons (spy and sniper)
ALT (hold)		- zoom in (spy)
Middle mouse bt		- Quick axtinguish

Spy script hides the primary after shooting so you can see more of the screen.


That's basically it. Not much, but useful.
